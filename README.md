Challenge #5: Server-Side APIs

## User Story
A daily planner that allows you to easily add important events to your schedule so you can manage your time effectively. With this planner, you can stay on top of your game and conquer your busy schedule.

## Acceptance Criteria
When using the daily planner to create a schedule:
* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar when the planner is opened.
* Scrolling down presents time blocks for standard business hours.
* Viewing time blocks for the day shows each block color-coded to indicate if it's in the past, present, or future.
* Clicking on a time block allows entry of an event.
* Saving an event text for a time block is done by clicking the "save" button for that block.
* Saved events persist even after refreshing the page, as they're stored in local storage.
